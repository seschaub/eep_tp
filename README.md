## R-Code: Global Relationships between Time Preference and Environmental Policy Performance by Sergei Schaub
<br>

I provide here the R-code for reproducing Schaub (2021). 
<br>
<br>
 
The code is structured into <br> 
- *'epp_master_file.R'*: the master R script <br>
- *'epp_data_preparation.R'*: runs the data main preparation <br>
- *'epp_data_summary.R'*: runs the data summary <br>
- *'epp_analysis.R'*: runs the main analysis <br>
- *'epp_specification_charts.R'*: produces the specification charts of the paper <br>
- *'epp_non_bootstrapped_models.R'*: runs the non-bootstrapped regression models <br>
- *'epp_direct_effects.R'*: runs the analysis of the separate direct effects (sensu Acharya et al. (2016)) <br>
- *'epp_alternative_time_preferece_data.R'*: runs the data preparation and analysis of the additional time preference indices/appoximations <br>
<br>
<br>

In order to run the analysis you need to follow the steps explained in the *'epp_master_file.R'* <br>
<br>
<br>

The data of the paper can be found under Schaub et al. (2021b) (https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000485215)
